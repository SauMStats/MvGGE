Description: Performs joint multi-phenotype testing for genetic main effects and 
    gene-environment interactions using MANOVA for continuous phenotypes and GEE 
    (Generalized Estimating Equations) for binary and mixed phenotypes. The package
    provides a unified testing framework that automatically detects phenotype types
    and applies appropriate statistical methods.
